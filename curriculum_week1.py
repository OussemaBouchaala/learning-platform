    "title": "Mutable defaults and references", "minutes": 75,
    "why": "You missed Q1. Python passes references to objects, and default arguments are created once.",
    "lesson": """
## Names point to objects

A variable doesn't contain a value. It's a name pointing to an object. Assignment never copies; it points another name at the same object.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a          # same list, no copy
b.append(4)
print(a)       # [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(a is b, id(a) == id(b))
```

`==` asks "same value?", `is` asks "same object?", and `id()` shows identity.

## Mutable vs immutable

Immutable objects (int, str, tuple) can't change, so any "change" makes a new object and moves the name. Mutable objects (list, dict, set) change in place, and every name pointing at them sees it.

```python
x = 10; y = x; y += 1
print(x)       # 10: int is immutable, y was rebound

a = [1]; b = a; b += [2]
print(a)       # [1, 2]: list += mutates in place
```

## Functions get references too

A parameter is a new name for the caller's object. Mutating it changes the caller's object; reassigning it doesn't.

```python
def mutate(lst): lst.append(99)
def rebind(lst): lst = [99]

data = [1]
mutate(data); print(data)
rebind(data); print(data)
```

## The mutable default trap

Default values are created once, when the `def` line runs, and reused on every call.

```python
def add(x, items=[]):
    items.append(x)
    return items

print(add(1), add(2))
print(add.__defaults__)
```

Fix: use `None` as a sentinel and build a fresh object inside. In a long-running FastAPI server, a mutable default leaks data between requests.

## Shallow vs deep copy

`.copy()`, `list(a)`, `a[:]` copy only the outer container. `copy.deepcopy()` copies everything inside.

```python
import copy
a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
s, d = a.copy(), copy.deepcopy(a)
a[0].append(99)
print(s)
print(d)
```

    "title": "Async and the event loop in FastAPI", "minutes": 75,
    "why": "You missed Q2, and your services run on FastAPI. Blocking the loop is a real production bug.",
    "lesson": """
## One thread, many tasks

asyncio runs an event loop on a single thread. A coroutine runs until it hits `await`, then hands control back so other tasks can run. Concurrency comes from waiting cooperatively, not from parallel threads.

```python
import asyncio, time

async def job(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)   # yields to the loop while waiting
    return n

async def main():
    t = time.perf_counter()
    print(await asyncio.gather(job(1), job(2), job(3)))
    print(f"{time.perf_counter() - t:.2f}s")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Three 1-second waits finish in about 1 second total.

## Blocking calls freeze everything

`time.sleep`, `requests.get`, a synchronous database driver, or heavy CPU work inside a coroutine never yields. The whole loop stops, so every other request waits.

```python
import asyncio, time

async def bad(n):
    time.sleep(1)            # blocks the loop
    return n

async def main():
    t = time.perf_counter()
    await asyncio.gather(bad(1), bad(2), bad(3))
    print(f"{time.perf_counter() - t:.2f}s")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## How FastAPI treats your endpoints

- `async def` endpoints run directly on the event loop. Only use non-blocking (awaitable) I/O inside them.
- Plain `def` endpoints run in a thread pool, so blocking code there doesn't freeze the loop.
- If you must call blocking code from `async def`, use `await run_in_threadpool(fn, *args)`.

## Today's experiment

You'll run a small FastAPI app **in your terminal** (servers can't run inside Bench, since they never finish), then fire concurrent requests at it from `load_test.py` here.

```bash
cd ml-fundamentals-lab/day02
uvicorn app_async:app --port 8001

DAY3 = {

    "title": "Generators, decorators, context managers", "minutes": 75,
    "why": "Standard interview territory, and all three show up in ML and API code.",
    "lesson": """
## Generators: values on demand

A function with `yield` returns a generator. It produces one value at a time and keeps its state between them, so it never builds the whole sequence in memory.

```python
def count_up(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

g = count_up(3)
print(next(g), next(g), list(g))
print(list(g))   # exhausted: a generator runs once
```

Use them to stream large files, batches, or API pages.

## Decorators: functions that wrap functions

A decorator takes a function and returns a new one. It works because inner functions remember variables from the enclosing scope (closures). `functools.wraps` keeps the original name and docstring.

```python
import functools, time

def timed(fn):
    @functools.wraps(fn)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{fn.__name__} took {time.perf_counter() - start:.4f}s")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timed
def work():
    return sum(range(1_000_000))

work()
print(work.__name__)
```

## Context managers: guaranteed cleanup

`with` runs setup, your block, then cleanup, even if the block raises. You can write one as a class (`__enter__` / `__exit__`) or with `@contextmanager` and `try/finally`.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import time

@contextmanager
def timer(label):
    start = time.perf_counter()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        print(f"{label}: {time.perf_counter() - start:.4f}s")

with timer("sum"):
    sum(range(1_000_000))
```

DAY4 = {

    "title": "Overfitting, bias and variance", "minutes": 75,
    "why": "You missed Q3. Read the train/validation gap, not the absolute scores.",
    "lesson": """
## Two ways a model fails

- **High bias (underfitting):** the model is too simple. Train and validation errors are both high and close together.
- **High variance (overfitting):** the model memorizes the training set. Train error is low, validation error is much higher.

The gap between train and validation tells you which one you have.

## Seeing it with polynomials

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
x = np.sort(rng.uniform(0, 1, 20))
y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * x) + rng.normal(0, 0.2, 20)

xs = np.linspace(0, 1, 200)
for deg in (1, 4, 15):
    coefs = np.polyfit(x, y, deg)
    plt.plot(xs, np.polyval(coefs, xs), label=f"degree {deg}")
plt.scatter(x, y, c="k", s=15)
plt.ylim(-2, 2); plt.legend(); plt.show()
```

Degree 1 misses the shape (bias). Degree 15 chases the noise (variance).

## Remedies, in order

For **variance**: get more data or augment it, add regularization (L2, dropout, max_depth), simplify the model, stop early.
For **bias**: add capacity or better features, reduce regularization, train longer.

## Learning curves

Plot train and validation scores as the training set grows. If validation keeps rising toward train, more data will help (variance). If both plateau low and close together, more data won't help (bias).

    "lesson": """
## The accuracy trap

With 0.5% positives, a model that always says "negative" scores 99.5% accuracy and catches nothing.

## The metrics that matter

- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP): of what I flagged, how much was right?
- **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN): of all real positives, how many did I catch?
- **F1** = 2PR / (P + R): balances both; low if either is low.
- **PR-AUC** summarizes precision vs recall across thresholds and focuses on the positive class.
- **ROC-AUC** uses the false positive rate, whose denominator is the huge negative class, so it can look good even when the positives are handled badly.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, accuracy_score

y_true = np.array([0] * 995 + [1] * 5)
y_pred = np.zeros(1000, dtype=int)
print("accuracy", accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred))
print("recall", recall_score(y_true, y_pred))
print("f1", f1_score(y_true, y_pred, zero_division=0))
```

## Thresholds are a choice

Classifiers output probabilities; 0.5 is just a default. Raising the threshold usually raises precision and lowers recall. Pick it from the cost of each error: missing fraud costs more than a false alarm.

## What leakage is

Leakage is any information from the evaluation data, or from the future, reaching the model during training. Scores look great offline and collapse in production.

## Preprocessing leakage

Fitting a scaler, imputer, encoder, feature selector, or SMOTE on the full dataset lets test statistics shape training. Fit them on training data only.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
X = rng.normal(size=(100, 5000))   # pure noise
y = rng.integers(0, 2, 100)

X_sel = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=20).fit_transform(X, y)   # leaks!
print("leaky:", cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000), X_sel, y, cv=5).mean())

pipe = make_pipeline(SelectKBest(f_classif, k=20), LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
print("honest:", cross_val_score(pipe, X, y, cv=5).mean())
```

On pure noise, the leaky version looks like it learned something. The pipeline shows the truth: about 50%.

## Target leakage

A feature that is only known after, or because of, the label. Example: predicting loan default with "account sent to collections".

## The fix: Pipelines

Put every fitted step inside a `Pipeline` and pass the pipeline to cross-validation. Each fold then fits preprocessing on its own training part only. For SMOTE, use `imblearn.pipeline.Pipeline`.

## Why random splits lie on time series

Neighboring time steps are nearly identical. A random split puts near-duplicates in both train and test, so the model scores well by memorizing, not generalizing. In production it must predict the future from the past.

## Forward-chaining splits

`TimeSeriesSplit` trains on earlier data and validates on later data, fold after fold.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

X = np.arange(12).reshape(-1, 1)
for train, test in TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3).split(X):
    print("train", train, "test", test)
```

## Group splits

When the question is "does it work on a new cow, patient, or user?", keep every sample of a group on one side with `GroupKFold`.

## Your MmCows result, explained

The naive 70/15/15 split put frames seconds apart into train and test. Those frames show the same cow in nearly the same place and posture, so the 17-class YOLO "recognized" cows by memorizing positions. Testing on a separate 2-hour period with different lighting removed that shortcut: mAP@0.5 fell from 0.987 to 0.481. That's the answer you need to give fluently in interviews.
